This folder holds the project files for an analysis on the Democratic and Repbulican memos on Russian interference in the 2016 election. 
The Python script cleans the text files, produces summary statistics, and runs a term frequency-inverse document frequency algorithm. 
The goal is to determine which words are similar across memos, and which ideas both parties think are important. 
Visit https://public.tableau.com/profile/allie.saizan#!/vizhome/Memos/Dash for the graphical analysis of the results.
